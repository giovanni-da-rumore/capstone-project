## About

Named after a myth from Plato's Phaedrus, *Cicadas Song* is a Genius-inspired
digital library that allows users to read, upload and annotate texts. The site runs primarily on a Backbone.js front end, straddling a RESTful Rails API.
It also uses jQuery, stores images on AWS S3, and supports multi-table lookup through PgSearch.




## Authentication

Authentication is done in Rails and allows users to be signed in from more than one
location at a time. If you're demoing, feel free to sign in under the guest account.
Also, some features such as Text-promotions, Text-Edit and Annotation-Deletion require being signed in under
a moderator account. If you'd like to try out these features, just email me at jsl2184@gmail.com and I can upgrade
your account.
